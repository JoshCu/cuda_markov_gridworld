# Metrics  
This folder contains metrics generated by running the different binaries against the different cases

There are individual files for separate testing, but the omni.py runs and collates all of them

## Method

Each size grid is run 10 times with 10 different cases and then an average is taken to get to the recorded times

### runtime.csv  
This csv contains
Case Size, CPU runtime, GPU4, GPU8, GPU16, GPU32

where the number after gpu is the selected tilewidth

### computation.csv  
This csv is the same format as above, but contains just the computation time, it doesn't include any of the overhead of loading the file or the initial host to device copy.
